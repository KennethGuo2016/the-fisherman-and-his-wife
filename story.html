				<p><a>Once upon a time there was a fisherman who lived with his wife in a piss pot near the sea. Every day the fisherman went out to fish, and all he did was fish and fish. One day he was sitting with his line and gazing into the clear water. And all he did was sit and sit. Suddenly his line sank deep down to the bottom, and when he pulled it up, he had a large flounder on the line, and the flounder said to him, "Listen here, fisherman, I beg of you, let me live. I'm not a real flounder but an enchanted prince. So what good would it do you to kill me? I certainly wouldn’t taste very good. Put me back into the water, and let me go." </a></p>

				</div>

				<p><a>"Hold on," said the man. "You don’t have to waste your words on me. I would have thrown a talking fish back into the water anyway" </a></p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>He then put the fish back into the clear water, and the flounder swam to the bottom, leaving behind a long streak of blood. Then the fisherman stood up and returned to the piss pot to be with his wife and told her that he had caught a flounder but since it had been an enchanted prince, he had let him go. </a></p>

				<p><a>“Didn’t you wish for anything?” asked the wife. </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," said the woman, "didn't you catch anything today?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>“No,” said the husband. “What should I have wished for?”</a></p>
				<p><a>“Ah,” said the wife. “Don’t you think it’s awful that we’ve got to live in this piss pot? It stinks, and it’s disgusting. You should have wished for a little hut. Go back and call him. Tell him we want a little hut. I’m sure he’ll give us one.”</a></p>

					<a>
						The husband didn’t think that this was the right thing to do, but he went back to the sea anyway, and when he arrived, the sea was green and yellow, and he stood on the shore and said: 
					</a>
				</p>

				<blockquote>
				Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!<br> 
				Flounder, flounder, in the sea!<br> 
				My wife, my wife Ilsebill,<br> 
				Wants not, wants not, what I will
				</blockquote>

				<p><a>The flounder swam up and said, "What does she want then?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh," said the man, "I did catch you, and now my wife says that I really 
				should have asked for something. She doesn't want to live in a filthy 
				shack any longer. She would like to have a cottage."  </a></p>

							<i>She doesn't want to live<br> in a filthy shack any longer. <br>She would like to have a cottage</i>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Go home," said the flounder. "She already has it."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>The man went home, and his wife was standing in the door of a cottage, and 
				she said to him, "Come in. See, now isn't this much better?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>There was a little front yard, and a beautiful little parlor, and a 
				bedroom where their bed was standing, and a kitchen, and a dining room. 
				Everything was beautifully furnished and supplied with tin and brass 
				utensils, just as it should be. And outside there was a little yard with 
				chickens and ducks and a garden with vegetables and fruit.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Look," said the woman. "Isn't this nice?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Yes," said the man. "This is quite enough. We can live here very well." 
				</a></p>
				<p><a>"We will think about that," said the woman.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then they ate something and went to bed.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Everything went well for a week or two, and then the woman said, "Listen, 
				husband. This cottage is too small. The yard and the garden are too 
				little. The flounder could have given us a larger house. I would like to 
				live in a large stone palace. Go back to the flounder and tell him to give 
				us a palace."  </a></p>

							<i>The flounder could have given us <br>a larger house. I would like to

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Oh, wife," said the man, "the cottage is good enough. Why would we want 
				to live in a palace?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"I know why," said the woman. "Now you just go. The flounder can do that."  
				</a></p>
				<p><a>"Now, wife, the flounder has just given us the cottage. I don't want to go 
				back so soon. It may make the flounder angry."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Just go," said the woman. "He can do it, and he won't mind doing it. Just 
				go."  </a></p>
				<p><a>The man's heart was heavy, and he did not want to go. He said to himself, 
				"This is not right," but he went anyway.  </a></p>
				<p><a>When he arrived at the sea the water was purple and dark blue and gray and 
				dense, and no longer green and yellow. He stood there and said: </a></p>

				<blockquote>
				Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!<br> 
				Flounder, flounder, in the sea!<br> 
				My wife, my wife Ilsebill,<br> 
				Wants not, wants not, what I will
				</blockquote>

				<p><a>"What does she want then?" said the flounder.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh," said the man sadly, "my wife wants to live in a stone palace."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container1">

							<i>My wife wants to live<br> in a stone palace</i>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Go home. She's already standing before the door," said the flounder.  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container2">

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>Then the man went his way, thinking he was going home, but when he 
				arrived, standing there was a large stone palace. His wife was standing on 
				the stairway, about to enter.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Taking him by the hand, she said, "Come inside."  </a></p>
				<p><a>He went inside with her. Inside the palace there was a large front hallway 
				with a marble floor. Numerous servants opened up the large doors for them. 
				The walls were all white and covered with beautiful tapestry. In the rooms 
				there were chairs and tables of pure gold. Crystal chandeliers hung from 
				the ceilings. The rooms and chambers all had carpets. Food and the very 
				best wine overloaded the tables until they almost collapsed. Outside the 
				house there was a large courtyard with the very best carriages and stalls 
				for horses and cows. Furthermore there was a magnificent garden with the 
				most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees and a pleasure forest a good 
				half mile long, with elk and deer and hares and everything that anyone 
				could possibly want.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Now," said the woman, "isn't this nice?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh, yes" said the man. "This is quite enough. We can live in this 
				beautiful palace and be satisfied."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"We'll think about it," said the woman. "Let's sleep on it." And with that 
				they went to bed.  </a></p>
				<p><a>The next morning the woman woke up first. It was just daylight, and from 
				her bed she could see the magnificent landscape before her. Her husband 
				was just starting to stir when she poked him in the side with her elbow 
				and said, "Husband, get up and look out the window. Look, couldn't we be 
				king over all this land?"  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container2">
					<div class="wife wife-lg">

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Oh, wife," said the man, "why would we want to be king? I don't want to 
				be king."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Well," said the woman, "even if you don't want to be king, I want to be 
				king."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh, wife," said the man, "why do you want to be king? I don't want to 
				tell him that."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Why not?" said the woman, "Go there immediately. I must be king."  </a></p>
				<p><a>So the man, saddened because his wife wanted to be king, went back.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"This is not right, not right at all," thought the man. He did not want to 
				go, but he went anyway.  </a></p>
				<p><a>When he arrived at the sea it was dark gray, and the water heaved up from 
				below and had a foul smell. He stood there and said: </a></p>

				<blockquote>
				Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!<br> 
				Flounder, flounder, in the sea!<br> 
				My wife, my wife Ilsebill,<br> 
				Wants not, wants not, what I will
				</blockquote>

				<p><a>"What does she want then," said the flounder.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh," said the man, "she wants to be king."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container1">

					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Go home. She is already king," said the flounder.  </a></p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>Then the man went home, and when he arrived there, the palace had become 
				much larger, with a tall tower and magnificent decorations. Sentries stood 
				outside the door, and there were so many soldiers, and drums, and 
				trumpets. When he went inside everything was of pure marble and gold with 
				velvet covers and large golden tassels. Then the doors to the great hall 
				opened up, and there was the entire court. His wife was sitting on a high 
				throne of gold and diamonds. She was wearing a large golden crown, and in 
				her hand was a scepter of pure gold and precious stones. On either side of 
				her there stood a line of maids-in-waiting, each one a head shorter than 
				the other.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh, wife, are you now king?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Yes," she said, "now I am king."  </a></p>
				<p><a>He stood and looked at her, and after thus looking at her for a while he 
				said, "Wife, it is very nice that you are king. Now we don't have to wish 
				for anything else."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"No, husband," she said, becoming restless. "Time is on my hands. I cannot 
				stand it any longer. Go to the flounder. I am king, but now I must become 
				emperor."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container2">
					<div class="wife wife-md">
						<img class="wife-img" src="images/wife.jpg" alt="wife">
						<div class="say common-height">
							<i>I am king, but now <br>I must become emperor!</i>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Oh, wife" said the man, "Why do you want to become emperor?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," she said, "go to the flounder. I want to be emperor." </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh, wife," said the man, "he cannot make you emperor. I cannot tell the 
				flounder to do that. There is only one emperor in the realm. The flounder 
				cannot make you emperor. He cannot do that."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"What!" said the woman. "I am king, and you are my husband. Are you going? 
				Go there immediately. If he can make me king then he can make me emperor. 
				I want to be and have to be emperor. Go there immediately."  </a></p>
				<p><a>So he had to go. As he went on his way the frightened man thought to 
				himself, "This is not going to end well. To ask to be emperor is shameful. 
				The flounder is going to get tired of this."  </a></p>
				<p><a>With that he arrived at the sea. The water was all black and dense and 
				boiling up from within. A strong wind blew over him that curdled the 
				water. He stood there and said: </a></p>

				<blockquote>
				Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!<br> 
				Flounder, flounder, in the sea!<br> 
				My wife, my wife Ilsebill,<br> 
				Wants not, wants not, what I will
				</blockquote>

				<p><a>"What does she want then?" said the flounder.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh, flounder," he said, "my wife wants to become emperor." </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container1">
					<div class="fisherman fisherman-md">

				</div>

				<p><a>"Go home," said the flounder. "She is already emperor."  </a></p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>Then the man went home, and when he arrived there, the entire palace was 
				made of polished marble with alabaster statues and golden decoration. 
				Soldiers were marching outside the gate, blowing trumpets and beating 
				tympani and drums. Inside the house, barons and counts and dukes were 
				walking around like servants. They opened the doors for him, which were 
				made of pure gold. He went inside where his wife was sitting on a throne 
				made of one piece of gold a good two miles high, and she was wearing a 
				large golden crown that was three yards high, all set with diamonds and 
				carbuncles. In the one hand she had a scepter, and in the other the 
				imperial orb. Bodyguards were standing in two rows at her sides: each one 
				smaller than the other, beginning with the largest giant and ending with 
				the littlest dwarf, who was no larger than my little finger. Many princes 
				and dukes were standing in front of her.  </a></p>
				<p><a>The man went and stood among them and said, "Wife, are you emperor now?"  
				</a></p>
				<p><a>"Yes," she said, "I am emperor."  </a></p>
				<p><a>He stood and looked at her, and after thus looking at her for a while, he 
				said, "Wife, it is very nice that you are emperor."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," she said. "Why are you standing there? Now that I am emperor, 
				and I want to become pope."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->
				<div class="container2">
					<div class="wife wife-md">

						<div class="say" id="wife-says-4">
							<i>Now that I am emperor,<br> and I want to become pope.</i>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>"Oh, wife!" said the man. "What do you not want? There is only one pope in 
				all Christendom. He cannot make you pope."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," she said, "I want to become pope. Go there immediately. I must 
				become pope this very day."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"No, wife," he said, "I cannot tell him that. It will come to no good. 
				That is too much. The flounder cannot make you pope."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband, what nonsense!" said the woman. "If he can make me emperor, then 
				he can make me pope as well. Go there immediately. I am emperor, and you 
				are my husband. Are you going?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then the frightened man went. He felt sick all over, and his knees and 
				legs were shaking, and the wind was blowing over the land, and clouds flew 
				by as the darkness of evening fell. Leaves blew from the trees, and the 
				water roared and boiled as it crashed onto the shore. In the distance he 
				could see ships, shooting distress signals as they tossed and turned on 
				the waves. There was a little blue in the middle of the sky, but on all 
				sides it had turned red, as in a terrible lightning storm. Full of despair 
				he stood there and said: </a></p>

				<blockquote>
				Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!<br> 
				Flounder, flounder, in the sea!<br> 
				My wife, my wife Ilsebill,<br> 
				Wants not, wants not, what I will
				</blockquote>

				<p><a>"What does she want then?" said the flounder.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Oh," said the man, "she wants to become pope."  </a></p>

				<!--a character image and dialogue box-->

					</div>
				</div>

				<p><a>Then he went home, and when he arrived there, there was a large church 
				surrounded by nothing but palaces. He forced his way through the crowd. 
				Inside everything was illuminated with thousands and thousands of lights, 
				and his wife was clothed in pure gold and sitting on a much higher throne. 
				She was wearing three large golden crowns. She was surrounded with 
				church-like splendor, and at her sides there were two banks of candles. 
				The largest was as thick and as tall as the largest tower, down to the 
				smallest kitchen candle. And all the emperors and kings were kneeling 
				before her kissing her slipper.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Wife," said the man, giving her a good look, "are you pope now?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Yes," she said, "I am pope."  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then he stood there looking at her, and it was as if he were looking into 
				the bright sun. After he had looked at her for a while he said, "Wife, It 
				is good that you are pope!"  </a></p>
				<p><a>She stood there as stiff as a tree, neither stirring nor moving.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then he said, "Wife, be satisfied now that you are pope. There is nothing 
				else that you can become."  </a></p>
				<p><a>"I have to think about that," said the woman.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then they both went to bed, but she was not satisfied. Her desires would 
				not let her sleep. She kept thinking what she wanted to become next.  </a></p>
				<p><a>The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a lot during the day, 
				but the woman could not sleep at all, but tossed and turned from one side 
				to the other all night long, always thinking about what she could become, 
				but she could not think of anything.  </a></p>
				<p><a>Then the sun was about to rise, and when she saw the early light of dawn 
				she sat up in bed and watched through the window as the sun came up.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Aha," she thought. "Could not I cause the sun and the moon to rise?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," she said, poking him in the ribs with her elbow, "wake up and 
				go back to the flounder. I want to become like God." </a></p>
				<p><a>The man, who was still mostly asleep, was so startled that he fell out of 
				bed. He thought that he had misunderstood her, so, rubbing his eyes, he 
				said, "Wife, what did you say?"  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Husband," she said, "I cannot stand it when I see the sun and the moon 
				rising, and I cannot cause them to do so. I will not have a single hour of 
				peace until I myself can cause them to rise."  </a></p>
				<p><a>She looked at him so gruesomely that he shuddered.  </a></p>
				<p><a>"Go there immediately. I want to become like God."  </a></p>

				<p><a>"Oh, wife," said the man, falling on his knees before her, "the flounder

				<p><a>Anger fell over her. Her hair flew wildly about her head. Tearing open her 
				bodice she kicked him with her foot and shouted, "I cannot stand it! I 
				cannot stand it any longer! Go there immediately!"  </a></p>
