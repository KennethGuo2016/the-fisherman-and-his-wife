					<h1>STORY BACKGROUND</h1>
					<br>
					<p>"The Fisherman and His Wife" illustration by Alexander Zick.</p>
					<p>"<b>The Fisherman and His Wife</b>" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale no. 19. It is Aarne–Thompson type 555, the fisherman and his wife. Its theme was used in The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish, an 1833 poem by Aleksandr Pushkin. Virginia Woolf has her character Mrs. Ramsey in To the Lighthouse read a version of the story to her son, James. Günter Grass's 1977 novel, The Flounder, is loosely based on the fairy tale, as are Emanuele Luzzati's version, Punch and the Magic Fish, and Ursula LeGuin's novel The Lathe of Heaven.</p>

					<h1>SUMMARY AND INSIGHTS</h1>
					<br>
					<p>The tale of the fisherman and his wife is a fairytale about a wife that asked the impossible from her husband. He caught a magical fish, and she asked him to let her live. He was kind hearted and pleased her demand, and she granted him three wishes. The fisherman had no desires, and he let her swim on.</p>
					<p>When he told his wife what had happened, she told him she wants the fish to grant her wishes. The fisherman wasn’t thrilled about it because he thought we shouldn’t take advantage of other people’s kindness and he was also pleased with his life and didn’t ask for anything more, unlike his wife.</p>
					<p>The moral of the story is that greedy people will never be satisfied and that they equalize they desire to have something with pricey things. Those are the people that will take advantage of other people’s kindness, and their only goal is to satisfy their selfish needs. The fisherman’s wife has an appetite that can’t be fed, and in the end, she is left with nothing. She is left with her husband in the small house, but she can’t see everything she has due to her greed.</p>
					<p><b>Genre</b>: fairytale</p>
					<p><b>Place</b>: beach, sea, castle/house</p>
